        <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. - Authorities are seeking the public's assistance in identifying a couple suspected of stealing Pub Sub sandwiches from a Publix store in Florida over the weekend.

            According to the Lee County Sheriff's Office, the man and woman entered the grocery store on Del Prado Boulevard in Cape Coral and approached the deli to pick up an online order for two whole turkey subs.
            
            When the deli clerk couldn't locate their order, they decided to make new sandwiches.

            Deputies reported that the man took the freshly made subs from the clerk and the couple exited the store without paying. They left in a black Ford Explorer.
            
            The subs were valued at $9.99 each, totaling $21.28, deputies stated.
            
            The store manager indicated a desire to press charges.
            
            Anyone who can identify the couple is urged to contact the sheriff's office at 239-477-1000.</p>

        <p>A resident of the Village of Hammock at Fenney, Sheldon Scott Engstrom, 60, has been jailed without bond due to a probation violation stemming from a golf cart road rage incident.

            Engstrom was taken into custody Tuesday night at the Sumter County Detention Center. Last September, he pleaded no contest to battery and resisting arrest charges related to the incident and was sentenced to one year of probation, 40 hours of community service, anger management classes, and to write a letter of apology.
            
            However, Engstrom violated his probation when he was arrested for driving under the influence on May 24.</p>
