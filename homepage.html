            <h4>A Florida man under the influence overturned a golf cart, sought refuge in bushes, and urinated on himself.</h4>
            <a href="https://www.villages-news.com/2024/07/05/villager-allegedly-flips-golf-cart-and-flees-scene-of-crash/"><img src="imaging/drunkgolfcart.png" alt="police cars"></a>
            <p>A resident of The Villages was apprehended after overturning his golf cart and attempting to flee the scene.

                Gary Steven Breault, aged 58 and residing at 908 Aloha Way in the Historic Side of The Villages, was discovered hiding in nearby bushes following the incident at approximately 10 a.m. on the Fourth of July at El Camino Real and Cazares Avenue, as detailed in a report from the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office.
                
                According to witnesses, including a gate guard at the Village of Santo Domingo entrance, Breault was seen driving the golf cart that subsequently overturned. Deputies found the golf cart key in his possession.
                
                Breault, originally from Highlands, N.Y., displayed signs of intoxication and admitted to consuming five beers. He declined to participate in field sobriety tests. Authorities discovered an unopened bottle of 99 XXXPRESSO Coffee 99 proof liquor in the golf cart’s cup holder, along with an open bottle of 99 Pineapple liquor near the brake pedal.
                
                Following his arrest, Breault was taken to the UF Health Emergency Room Clinic at Brownwood for medical evaluation, during which deputies noted he had apparently urinated in his shorts. He refused to provide a breath sample.
                
                He faces charges of driving under the influence and hit and run, and was subsequently booked at the Sumter County Detention Center. Additionally, he is subject to custody holds from New York authorities.</p>

            <h3>NJ Gamer Attacks FL Man With Hammer After Online Dispute: Sheriff</h3>

            <p class="description">A New Jersey man has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly flying to Florida and attacking another gamer with a hammer over an online disagreement, authorities reported.

                The two men had never met in person before the suspect appeared at the victim's home in Fernandina Beach over the weekend "apparently to confront the victim," Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leeper said during a Monday press briefing.
                
                The incident is believed to have stemmed from an "online altercation," Leeper said, describing the case as "a weird one."
                
                Edward Kang, 20, the suspect, allegedly entered the victim's home through an unlocked door. Wearing all-black clothing, gloves, and a mask, Kang attacked the victim with a hammer when the victim got up from gaming to use the bathroom late Saturday or early Sunday, according to Leeper.
                
                The victim, thought to be around the same age as Kang, managed to wrestle him to the ground. He and his stepfather, who woke up to the screams for help, disarmed and restrained the suspect until deputies arrived, Leeper said.
                
                "Upon arrival, they found a significant amount of blood in the entryway and the victim's bedroom," Leeper said.
                
                The victim sustained "severe" head injuries but has since been released from the hospital, according to the sheriff.
                
                Kang was booked into the Nassau County Jail on Sunday and charged with attempted second-degree murder and armed burglary. It is unclear if he has legal representation.
                
                Leeper mentioned that the investigation is ongoing and the charges could be upgraded.
                
                When questioned about his motive, Kang allegedly told deputies that the victim is a "bad person online." He also allegedly inquired about the jail time for breaking and entering and assault, Leeper said.
                
                "I would say, Mr. Kang, it will be a long time before you play video games," Leeper commented.
                
                The victim and suspect allegedly knew each other from the online video game ArcheAge, which will no longer be accessible in the United States as of Thursday due to declining player numbers, according to its publisher.
                
                Kang reportedly told his family he was going to meet a friend he had known for years through the game. He flew from Newark, New Jersey, to Jacksonville, Florida, and checked into a hotel near the victim's home early Friday morning. He allegedly bought a hammer and flashlight at a hardware store upon arriving in Florida, with receipts found in his hotel room, Leeper said.
                
                "This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential real-world consequences of online interaction," Leeper said. "We urge the public to exercise caution, report any suspicious online behavior to the authorities, and always ensure that their homes are securely locked."</p>

            <p class="description">A 30-year-old woman was arrested by Florida deputies after driving a stolen ambulance recklessly through the streets of Fort Myers on Thursday, June 20.

                Footage released by the Lee County Sheriff’s Office shows the police chase of Ariel Marchan-Le Quire.
                
                Deputies were initially called to Golisano Children’s Hospital on Thursday following reports of a stolen ambulance, according to the sheriff’s office.
                
                Marchan-Le Quire was driving erratically, swerving, drifting across lanes, hitting curbs, and nearly flipping the ambulance, the sheriff’s office reported.
                
                She eventually stopped at an intersection, where deputies managed to wrestle her from the driver’s seat and arrest her, the sheriff’s office said.
                
                Marchan-Le Quire was charged with grand theft of a motor vehicle, leaving the scene of a crash, resisting an officer, fleeing and eluding, and theft of emergency equipment. Credit: Lee County Sheriff’s Office via Storyful.</p>
